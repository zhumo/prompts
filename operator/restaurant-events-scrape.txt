Goal: Find the contact information for the events team at the restaurants listed in this google sheets doc:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bnHaysH6P8c3vRsKweqjF8Cw36uRpDjuevjNkmbOXSU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

For each row in the sheets doc, 
1. Visit the website of the restaurant
2. Find the events inquiry form and paste the url into the "Event Form Link" column of the spreadsheet.
3. Find the general inquiry email and paste it into the "General Contact Email" column of the spreadsheet.
- This is the email which is the general inbox of the restaurant. In many restaurants, this email might be "info@restaurant.com"
- You might find this in a dedicated "contact us" page or in the footer of the website. Look there first, then look elsewhere.
- the restaurant might belong in a restaurant group, so the contact info might be in the group's website
4. Find the events contact email and paste it into the "Events Contact Email" column of the spreadsheet.
- This is the email which is the direct inbox of the events team. In many restaurants this might be "events@restaurant.com"
- The email might be in a pdf which they use to advertise their event
- The restaurant might belong to a restaurant group, which has one team handling all of its locations' events. If so, visit the restaurant group's website to find the data

Keep things organized by closing all browser tabs except the spreadsheet after you are done with each restaurant. Never close the spreadsheet tab because you will need it to complete the task.

I'm looking for the contact information for the events team at the restaurants listed in this google sheets doc:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bnHaysH6P8c3vRsKweqjF8Cw36uRpDjuevjNkmbOXSU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

For each row in the sheets doc, 
1. Visit the website of the restaurant
2. Navigate around to look for three pieces of information: the events contact email, the general contact email, and the link to the events inquiry submission form
3. Fill in that information in the spreadsheet

The events contact info is the direct email to the events team. This is usually events@restuaurant.com. The general contact info is usually info@restaurant.com.

Some notes: 
- the email might be in a pdf which they use to advertise their event
- the restaurant might belong in a restaurant group, so the contact info might be in the group's website
